Pok√©dot is a Pok√©mon database that uses the [Veekun](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) Pok√©mon database. It contains
detailed information about every Pok√©mon, which includes: forms, types, base stats, evolutions, moves, and much more.
In the future, it will include a team builder allowing for easy composition of effective Pok√©mon teams.
