An AWS Lambda function scheduled to check for products in stock, with DynamoDB for recording when an alert was last sent
(to prevent spam), and SNS to then alert a user via SMS. <a className="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a>
is used to check for a specified selector, so adding new products is super simple!
